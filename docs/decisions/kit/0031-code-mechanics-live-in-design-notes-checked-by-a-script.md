# 0031. How code works lives in the design note of its area; a synced script checks the notes

Date: 2026-10-01
Status: accepted 2026-10-01

## Context

Since 2026-09-24 the kit's rule "No code structure in docs" said not to describe code structure in
`CLAUDE.md` or in docs, and to describe behaviour and decisions instead. Read literally, it was
broken from its first day: the ADR template asks for the tests that guard a decision, and the
kit's own `CLAUDE.md` names `Program.Run`. The first adopter worked another way. Its design notes
hold the mechanics of the code they cover, each says at the top which files it covers, and since
2026-09-27 a note repeats neither its `CLAUDE.md` nor a decision record; nothing checked any of it.
Measured on 2026-10-01 on its 21 notes: 23 "Covers:" passages, most inside the opening quote
block, with 190 code spans, 111 of which look like paths. 109 of those name files or folders that
exist, from the project root, from a code or test folder, from the notes' folder, or as a file name
found in the project; the other 2 both name `Report/AgainstReport.cs`, which does not exist. On
2026-09-30 the owner decided, in chat, decision Q7 of the programme: any file may name code as an
address; what code does and how its parts fit goes only in the design note of its area, which names
the code it covers and is updated or deleted with it; one whole-project map is allowed; a synced
script and a `/wrap-up` step keep the notes true. On 2026-10-01 the owner answered what this left
open: the rule covers the project's code and tests as `kit.json` names them; any file may also say
what a test or a check enforces; the Covers form the first adopter already writes is accepted; the
script lists the notes a branch touched; a project retires an index test of its own.

## Decision

- A rule of the kit, "Design notes": "Any file may name the project's code (the folders and files
  `kit.json` lists as code and tests) and say what a test or a check enforces. How that code
  works and how its parts fit go only in the design note of its area: a note in `docs/design/`
  whose `Covers:` sentence, above its first section, names the files it describes, and which is
  updated or deleted in the same task as that code. A note repeats neither `CLAUDE.md` nor an
  ADR; one note may map the whole project." The kit's `CLAUDE.md` drops its own rule "No code
  structure in docs". The guide and the READMEs keep explaining what the kit's own scripts do:
  they are not the project's code (ADR 0011).
- A Covers sentence starts at a "Covers:" marker, plain or emphasised, in a quote block or not;
  every note has one above its first heading of level 2 or more, and a section may have its own.
  Every Covers sentence names the files it describes as paths in backticks, at least one: a
  path must name a file or folder git has in the project, with its letter case, from the project
  root, from a code or test folder, from `docs/design/`, or as a file name found in the project.
  Spans that are no path (a class, a method, a flag) are not checked. Where a sentence ends,
  what looks like a path and which wildcards count are the script's grammar, written in its
  header and, for authors, in `docs/design/README.md`.
- `scripts/check-design.ps1`, synced like every script, is the step "design notes" of
  `scripts/verify.ps1`, after "decisions". It checks that the index `docs/design/README.md` names
  every note, that a note name in its table is a note, that every note has its Covers
  sentences, and that every path in them exists. With `-Since <ref>` it checks nothing and lists
  the notes whose Covers sentences name a code or test file (the scope of the rule) changed since
  `<ref>`; a new `/wrap-up` step runs it with `main` in the task's worktree, and each listed note
  is read against the change. Where HEAD is on `<ref>` itself it is an error, not an empty list.
- A project that takes the check retires any test of its own that checks the same index.

## Alternatives rejected

- **Keep "No code structure in docs".** It forbade what every ADR and `CLAUDE.md` do, naming code
  and tests, and gave the mechanics no home.
- **The rule for every file, the kit's scripts included.** The guide and the READMEs exist to
  explain the scripts (ADR 0011), and each script's header already says what it does.
- **A strict Covers form: the first line, paths from the project root only.** 78 of the first
  adopter's 111 path names would be rewritten, and nothing more would be checked.
- **A test in each project.** Tests are not synced; the first adopter's test checked the index
  only, and each project would write and keep its own.
- **List the touched notes by hand at `/wrap-up`.** Paths that start at a code folder, and bare
  file names, make a diff hard to match by eye; the script uses the same rules as the check.
- **Check the text of a note.** No script can tell whether a sentence still describes the code;
  the `/wrap-up` step sends the task to the notes it touched, and the reader judges. `/docs-health`
  cannot: its auditor never opens the code.
- **Walk the file system for the paths.** A file git ignores, or a folder kept on disk only by its
  build output, passed on the author's checkout and failed on the same commit in a fresh
  worktree; git's list of files is the same everywhere.
- **Let a Covers sentence name its code by class.** `-Since` matches changed files against
  paths; on the first adopter, notes that named a test class or a view model without its file
  were never listed when that file changed.

## Consequences

The gate has eight checks, and the check needs the project in a git repository. A file renamed
or deleted while a Covers sentence still names it turns the gate red until the note is fixed,
and so does a note added without a Covers sentence, a path or an index row. The first adopter's
two stale spans are fixed in its sync commit, its notes that named code only by class or in
prose name their files, and its index test is removed there; a test of its own keeps
`docs/design/` from disappearing, which the check, passing a project without notes, would not
see. Both projects allow `scripts/check-design.ps1` in their own `allow` list of
`.claude/settings.json`, so the `/wrap-up` step does not ask each time; the owner chose that on
2026-10-01, and it is not a process key. `DesignCheckTests` covers each rule of the check, the
forms of note it reads, and the listing on a git repository; on 2026-10-01, 22 of 23 single
changes to the script made a test fail, and the one left changes no output. The check never
judges whether a note still says what its code does; the `/wrap-up` step points at the notes to
read.
