# 0037. A decision log in a capped text file, formatted in Core, written by App

Date: 2026-10-26
Status: accepted 2026-10-26

## Context

The 2026-10-26 crash was diagnosed from outside the application: the Event Viewer gave the
process start time and the installer's steps, a WER mini dump gave the HRESULT and the loaded
modules, and a reproduction gave the stack. The application itself had recorded nothing: not
which runtime it started on, not that the restart registration had been made (R-100 ignores
its HRESULT), not that a reminder was due at 08:17 and what it decided. Since ADR 0036 a crash
leaves its text and stack in the Application log; what still leaves no trace is everything the
application decides without failing: a reminder skipped at unlock during a call (R-014) or held
back for full screen (R-033), a lock or unlock that never arrived, a setting that fell back to
its default (R-051), an auto-start entry repaired (R-006). Those are the likely complaints about
a reminder ("it did not appear"), and `--detect` answers them only live, at the keyboard.

The volume is small by construction: a start, a few locks and unlocks a day, one line per
reminder, one per change of a held-back reason, never one per tick or per retry. A day is some
tens of lines; 256 KB holds months.

## Decision

The tray copy keeps a decision log: `log.txt` in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MindfulnessReminder\`, one
line per event with the local time, capped at 262 144 bytes by one rotation to `log.1.txt`
(R-110). Core decides what is an event and renders every line (`DecisionLog`, `IDecisionLog`
as the seam, raised from `ReminderCoordinator`, `RegistrySettingsStore`, `StartupRegistrar` and
the crash path: R-111 to R-114). The writer, `FileDecisionLog`, is in Core as well, given its
folder by App, so that the rotation and the swallow rule run in the tests against a folder of
their own; it appends, rotates and swallows every I/O error. The log is always on; the file is
read in a text editor, and nothing in the tray menu or About points at it.

## Alternatives rejected

- **The Windows Application log, under the application's own source.** Registering an event
  source needs administrator rights (`EventLog.CreateEventSource`), which a tray app of one user
  does not have, and an unregistered source is refused or lands under a misleading name. The
  crash already reaches that log through the fail-fast (ADR 0036); the decisions do not need to.
- **An `EventSource` (ETW) and traces collected on demand.** Right for a service under
  observation, wrong for a tray app whose owner opens a file after the fact; nothing would be
  collected unless a session was running at the time.
- **A log that is off by default, switched on in Settings.** The one time the log is needed is
  the day nobody knew it would be; a switch that was off then is a log that does not exist. The
  cost of always on is a file of a few hundred kilobytes.
- **One line per retry while held back.** A long call at a 20-second retry would write 180 lines
  an hour that all say the same thing; the reason's change is the event, so that is the line.
- **A tray-menu item or an About line that opens the log.** It adds a menu item to a four-item
  menu for a file the owner opens a few times a year; the path is in the README.
- **The timestamp added in Core from `IClock`.** The settings store and the registrar have no
  clock, and UTC on a machine the owner reads in local time would need converting every time;
  the adapter stamps local time at the write, through one Core function (`FormatLine`) that the
  tests pin.
- **The messages left out of the settings summary.** The point of the line is to see exactly
  what the application read; the two texts are the user's own, in the user's own file.
- **The writer in App, as an adapter.** That is where it was first put, "the one piece checked
  only by a tray start". The code review of the same day found two defects in it that a test
  with a temp folder catches at once: a rotation that failed silenced the log for as long as
  `log.1.txt` stayed locked, and an unnamed profile folder sent the log into the working
  directory. It has no UI dependency, so the project's rule "logic in Core, adapters in App"
  settled it: the writer is in Core with the folder injected, and App only names the folder.

## Consequences

- A complaint about a reminder can be answered from the file: when the unlock arrived, what the
  coordinator decided and why, what the settings were. The start line says which runtime a copy
  ran on and whether Windows will restart it, two facts the 2026-10-26 diagnosis had to dig out.
- Every line is a pure function or a decision on fakes, tested in Core (R-110 to R-114), and so
  is the file: `FileDecisionLog` runs in the tests against a temp folder (the line, the cap, a
  replaced `log.1.txt`, a rotation that fails, a folder that cannot be created, an empty
  folder). What only a tray start checks is the folder App names and the wiring (ADR 0008).
  The writer reads `DateTimeOffset.Now` directly, the one Core type that reads a clock without
  `IClock`: the stamp is for the owner's eyes, in the owner's time, and no rule depends on it.
- `ReminderCoordinator`, `RegistrySettingsStore` and `StartupRegistrar` take an optional
  `IDecisionLog` and default to a null log, so no existing caller or test changes;
  `IAutoStartManager` gains `Command`, which `RegistryAutoStartManager` already had.
- `RestartRegistration.Register` returns the HRESULT instead of ignoring it, for the start line
  alone (R-100 still ignores a refusal).
- The log holds the command line the copy started with, the user's two reminder messages, the
  path of the executable and the text of a crash, whose messages can name a file or a registry
  key; it is in the user's own profile folder and nowhere else.
