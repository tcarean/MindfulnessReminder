# Mindfulness Reminder

A tray-resident break reminder for Windows. It shows an always-on-top reminder window on
every workstation unlock, and at a configurable interval while the user works -- unless the
user is on a call or in a full-screen application, in which case it waits. The two reminders
have a switch and a message each, and both say "Ground yourself" until changed. .NET 8,
**zero external dependencies**: WPF for the windows, Windows Forms for the tray icon, its menu
and `Screen`, both from the WindowsDesktop shared framework (ADR 0041).

## Commands

- Gate (what pre-commit, pre-merge-commit, the Claude commit hook and CI run):
  `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1`. About 25 s; on a
  branch that changes `scripts/` or `tests/MindfulnessReminder.ProcessTests/`, the process tests
  run too, at every commit, and it takes about three minutes (ADR 0075). `-All` runs them
  whatever changed.
- Fast loop, no tests: `... scripts/verify.ps1 -SkipTests`
- Build: `dotnet build MindfulnessReminder.sln -c Release --nologo` (Windows only: WPF). The
  SDK is 9.0.318 or a later 9.0.3xx, pinned in `global.json`; the projects target .NET 8
- Test: `dotnet test MindfulnessReminder.sln -c Release --nologo` (every test; without the
  process tests: `--filter "Category!=Process"`)
- One test: `dotnet test MindfulnessReminder.sln --filter "FullyQualifiedName~R024"`
- Format: `dotnet format MindfulnessReminder.sln` (check only: `--verify-no-changes`)
- See the reminder without locking the machine:
  `src\MindfulnessReminder.App\bin\Release\net8.0-windows\MindfulnessReminder.exe --preview ["text"]`
  (no tray icon, no registry, no timer; with a text, that text after the same normalization a
  saved one gets, R-045)
- See what the pause checks detect: `... MindfulnessReminder.exe --detect [seconds]`; with a
  duration it reports a timeline, the only way to test the full-screen check (R-080 to R-082).
  Neither switch claims the single-instance mutex, so both run beside the copy in the tray.
- Design notes a branch touched (the index and Covers paths are a gate step):
  `scripts/check-design.ps1 -Since main`
- Mutation score of Core (minutes, not in the gate): `scripts/mutate.ps1 [-Mutate "**/IntervalSchedule.cs"]`
- Release (verify with every test, version in `Directory.Build.props`, CHANGELOG, publish,
  zip; no commit, no tag): `scripts/release.ps1 -Version X.Y.Z [-WhatIf]`. It is also the one
  way the README builds the app (ADR 0076)
- Git hooks, once in every clone (sets `core.hooksPath` to `scripts/hooks`):
  `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/install-hooks.ps1`
- There are no validation figures: `docs/validation.json` lists no case (ADR 0039), so
  `/validate` has nothing to run.

## Layout

- `src/MindfulnessReminder.Core/` - `net8.0`, no UI dependency: every rule the app has
  (`ReminderCoordinator.cs`, `IntervalSchedule.cs`, `ReminderSettings.cs`,
  `SuppressionPolicy.cs`, `TrayTooltip.cs`, `DetectionLog.cs`, the settings store, auto-start,
  placement, version and licence) and the seams the adapters fill. All of it unit tested.
- `src/MindfulnessReminder.App/` - `net8.0-windows`, `WinExe`, the binary is
  `MindfulnessReminder.exe`: the three windows, the tray icon, the dark theme, and one Windows
  API per file behind a Core interface. Nothing here decides anything; none of it is
  unit-tested (ADR 0042).
- `tests/MindfulnessReminder.Tests/` - `net8.0`, references **Core only**: every rule on
  fakes, `RepoInvariantTests`, `LicenseHeaderTests`, `VersionTests`. `tests/testdata/` holds
  an empty manifest: there is no test data.
- `tests/MindfulnessReminder.ProcessTests/` - `net8.0`, references no project: the tests of
  `scripts/`, which run the real scripts and git in throwaway folders under `%TEMP%`; every
  class carries `Category=Process` (ADR 0075).
- `Directory.Build.props` - `<Version>` and `<Copyright>`, the single place for both (ADR
  0045), and the strictness every project builds with (ADR 0037).
- `process.json` - what the scripts, skills and agent need to know about this project: the
  solution, the code and test folders, the release, the process tests
  (`scripts/process-config.ps1` describes every key).
- The process: `scripts/` (the git hooks in `scripts/hooks/` included), `.claude/skills/`,
  `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/rules/process.md` (the process rules, loaded with this file) and
  the process keys of `.claude/settings.json` (the rule "Process files").
- `docs/requirements.md` - the behaviour, with IDs. `docs/decisions/` - the decision records,
  one sequence numbered by date (ADR 0075). `docs/validation.md` + `.json` - no figures, and
  why. `docs/design/` - the explanations, per area, read on demand. `docs/plans/` - approved
  plans. `README.md` - the user documentation.
- The project is the root of its own repository (ADR 0074). `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs
  the gate, every test included, on every push to `main` and every pull request.

## Rules

The process rules are in `.claude/rules/process.md`, loaded with this file. These are
Mindfulness Reminder's own; one that extends a process rule names it.

- **Zero external dependencies** (extends the rule "Packages"). `NotifyIcon` and
  everything else come from the shared framework; WPF having no numeric spinner is not a
  reason to add a package, the settings dialog hand-validates a `TextBox` (ADR 0041).
- **Logic in Core, adapters in App.** If a new rule cannot be tested because it sits in the
  App project, it is in the wrong project; the test project deliberately does not reference
  App, so the build enforces it (ADR 0042).
- **Licence headers.** Every `.cs` and `.xaml` file starts with the GPL notice, new files
  included; `LicenseHeaderTests` fails otherwise. XML comments cannot contain `--`, so the
  em-dash of C# comments is reworded in XAML (ADR 0043).
- **One timer, one deadline, on the wall clock.** The timer ticks every second and
  `IntervalSchedule` compares a deadline with `IClock.UtcNow`; never a timer armed for the
  interval, never a count of ticks. A lock suspends the schedule and an unlock restarts it in
  full, before the debounce and the already-showing check (ADR 0046 to ADR 0048).
- **Read the device, not the window title.** A call is the `ConsentStore` capture record;
  full screen is `SHQueryUserNotificationState` mapped in Core, and `QUNS_NOT_PRESENT` must
  not suppress. Do not reintroduce a table of window titles (ADR 0050, ADR 0051).
- **A periodic reminder is postponed, an unlock reminder is skipped**, and there is no cap on
  how long one is held back; the tooltip carries the reason (ADR 0052).
- **The activity monitor is never read on the one-second tick**: when a reminder is due, once
  per retry, and every 10 s idle so the tooltip is current (ADR 0053).
- **The coordinator picks the text, the presenter draws it.** `BringToFront` takes nothing;
  messages are normalized like numbers are clamped, and the dialog refuses a blank one only
  for a reminder that is on (ADR 0056, ADR 0057).
- **The reminder window is light and swallows Enter.** `BreakWindow` takes no dark theme, its
  Close button is not `IsDefault`, and Enter is handled in `OnPreviewKeyDown`; Settings and
  About are modeless, never `ShowDialog` (ADR 0060, ADR 0064).
- **The dark theme is merged per window, never into `Application.Resources`.** Every template
  carries its own disabled trigger; the palette is repeated in `DarkMenuRenderer` and never
  moves into Core (ADR 0064, ADR 0065).
- **Settings are strings, read forgivingly.** Eight string values under
  `HKCU\Software\MindfulnessReminder`, clamped or defaulted on reading, never rejected; the
  Settings dialog is the one place that refuses (ADR 0061).
- **The tray tooltip fits 63 characters.** `TrayTooltip` is the pure function that proves it
  (ADR 0059).
- **User documentation lives in `README.md`, and only there.** It is the single source for it;
  `docs/` explains what the code does and why, for whoever maintains it (ADR 0068). It is
  written for the people who use the app: what it does, the one line that builds it, how to
  use it, the licence. No process, no design rationale, no version history, no version number,
  and no mention of Claude or of the owner (ADR 0077).

## Workflow

The workflow in `.claude/rules/process.md` applies. Mindfulness Reminder adds:

- `/wrap-up` checks `README.md`, the user documentation. A change under
  `src/MindfulnessReminder.App/` is looked at with `--preview` (the reminder window only) or
  `--detect` (the activity monitor only); anything else of the App runs only in a full tray
  start, which from a worktree build repairs the auto-start entry to that build (R-006), so it
  is listed for the owner to look at in their own copy after the merge (ADR 0042).
- A release is tagged `vX.Y.Z`, the name `scripts/release.ps1` prints; it publishes the
  application framework-dependent into `artifacts/X.Y.Z/`, where the app runs from, and zips
  that folder into `artifacts/MindfulnessReminder-X.Y.Z-win-x64.zip` with its `.sha256` (ADR
  0036, ADR 0074, ADR 0076).

## Read before touching

`docs/design/README.md` maps every area to its note. The ones most likely to catch a careless
edit:

- `IntervalSchedule.cs`, `ReminderCoordinator.cs` or the tick: `docs/design/periodic-reminder.md`
  and ADR 0046 to ADR 0048.
- `HandleTick`, `SuppressionPolicy`, `WindowsActivityMonitor`, `--detect`:
  `docs/design/pausing.md` and ADR 0050 to ADR 0054.
- `ReminderSettings`, `HandleUnlock`, the messages: `docs/design/two-reminders.md` and ADR
  0055 to ADR 0058.
- Any XAML, a new window: `docs/design/dark-theme.md` and `docs/design/windows.md`, ADR 0060,
  ADR 0064 to ADR 0066.
- A new setting: `docs/design/settings-storage.md` and ADR 0061.
- `Version.cs`, `LicenseInfo.cs`, `LicenseHeaderTests`: `docs/design/versioning-and-licence.md`,
  ADR 0043 to ADR 0045.
- A script or a hook: its header, which says what it does and who calls it, and its tests in
  `tests/MindfulnessReminder.ProcessTests/` (ADR 0075).
- A file you have not opened before: `docs/design/code-map.md`.

## Style

- `.editorconfig` holds whitespace rules and `IDE0005`; `dotnet format` enforces them, and so
  does the build, which writes the XML documentation file for that reason (CS1591 muted).
  Warnings are errors, `EnforceCodeStyleInBuild` and `Nullable` are on, in
  `Directory.Build.props` (ADR 0037). The code-style rules beyond whitespace (braces, `var`)
  and the analyzers are not enabled: 374 analyzer findings on 2026-10-09, 352 of them the
  underscores in test names; a style pass is a task of its own.
- Test names are sentences with underscores, `R###_` first.
- Fix, do not suppress, unless the suppression carries a comment with the reason.
