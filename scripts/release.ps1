# release.ps1 - the mechanical part of a release: checks, version number, CHANGELOG, build.
#
# WHAT IT DOES
#   1. Checks, and stops without changing anything if one fails (the kit's ADR 0029):
#        - the checkout is the main checkout (not a linked worktree) and is on main, or on
#          the branch kit.json names as release.branch: a release is cut there, where the
#          owner commits and tags; a task branch, a detached HEAD or a worktree is refused;
#        - this project's working tree is clean;
#        - -Version is MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH without leading zeros (2.3.0, not 2.03.0, which
#          would compare as 2.3.0 but be written as 2.03.0), is not already a released
#          heading of CHANGELOG.md ("## [X.Y.Z] - date"), and is above the highest of them:
#          that is the floor, since a release always closes [Unreleased] under such a
#          heading (with none, no floor);
#        - -Version is not below <Version> in Directory.Build.props. It may equal it: the
#          owner may bump <Version> per feature, and the release then uses it;
#        - CHANGELOG.md has something under [Unreleased];
#        - every release.publish entry is in a kit project (a folder with kit.json, the one
#          nearest above the entry's project file). An entry in another project, a sibling
#          folder such as ../X/src/X.Cli/X.Cli.csproj, makes that project a *component* of
#          this release (the kit's ADR 0036): it must have a readable kit.json, a <Version>
#          in its Directory.Build.props and a CHANGELOG.md, and its folder must be clean.
#          It is published from its checkout as it is; it need not be released first;
#        - the git tag for this version does not exist yet.
#   2. Runs scripts/verify.ps1. If it is red, it stops; still nothing changed.
#   3. Writes the new version into <Version> in Directory.Build.props, unless it is already
#      there.
#   4. In CHANGELOG.md, turns "## [Unreleased]" into "## [X.Y.Z] - <today>" and puts a new,
#      empty "## [Unreleased]" above it.
#   5. Publishes what kit.json lists under release.publish into artifacts/<version>/, which
#      it empties first, unless -NoPublish:
#        - each entry with its own extra `dotnet publish` arguments into a staging folder,
#          artifacts/<version>/.stage/<n>/, then merged into artifacts/<version>/<output>/ by
#          scripts/merge-publish.ps1, which copies nothing when a file already there has other
#          bytes (a collision: two publishes that want different files at one path). A
#          collision stops the release after steps 3 and 4; the owner decides, usually an
#          output subfolder for that entry, and re-runs with -PublishOnly. .stage/ is removed
#          after the last merge;
#        - writes artifacts/<version>/release.json: this project's name (its folder), the
#          version, the date, the commit, and each component (this project first) with its
#          <Version>, its last commit, whether its CHANGELOG has [Unreleased] content and
#          whether its folder was clean (the two version files a full release has just
#          changed do not count). An entry that published a release.json at the root
#          collides with it. Outside git the commits are empty and clean is false;
#        - when kit.json sets release.zip, zips artifacts/<version>/ into artifacts/<zip name>
#          ("{version}" replaced) and writes the zip's SHA-256 beside it in <zip name>.sha256.
#   It commits nothing and tags nothing. At the end it prints the commit and the tag to
#   propose: the commit limited to Directory.Build.props and CHANGELOG.md, the tag vX.Y.Z in a
#   standalone repository, <folder>-vX.Y.Z inside a monorepo.
#
# WHO CALLS IT
#   - Claude, in the /release skill, in a session the owner opened in the project folder of
#     the main checkout: first with -WhatIf, then for real; the skill then proposes the commit
#     and the tag, which the owner runs (the kit's ADRs 0010, 0021 and 0029)
#   - you, by hand:
#       powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/release.ps1 -Version 0.2.0
#
# OPTIONS
#   -Version X.Y.Z   the new version; required
#   -WhatIf          run the step 1 checks and show what would change and which components
#                    would be bundled; touch nothing
#   -NoPublish       skip step 5
#   -PublishOnly     run step 5 alone for -Version, with none of the checks and no change to
#                    Directory.Build.props or CHANGELOG.md: the retry after a collision, or a
#                    measurement of what a release would publish, from any branch. With
#                    -WhatIf it lists the components and what it would publish, and stops
#
# RESULT
#   exit 0  done, or the -WhatIf preview finished; it prints the files changed and the tag
#   exit 1  a check failed or verify was red (nothing changed), or publish failed or two
#           publishes collided. A failed publish or a collision comes after steps 3 and 4:
#           Directory.Build.props and CHANGELOG.md are already changed at that point.
