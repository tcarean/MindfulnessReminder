# check-testdata.ps1 - checks that the test data files are present and unchanged.
#
# WHAT IT DOES
#   Reads manifest.json in the test data folder named by kit.json (testData.folder, in the
#   kit tests/testdata/), the list of every test data file with its SHA-256 hash (a
#   fingerprint of the file's bytes), and checks each file:
#     - "repo" files live in <testData.folder>/fixtures/ and must be there;
#     - "large" files are kept out of git, in <testData.folder>/large/ or in the folder named
#       by the environment variable kit.json calls testData.largeEnv (in the kit
#       STARTER_TESTDATA_LARGE). A missing one is only a yellow warning on your machine, but
#       an error in CI when its entry has "requiredInCi": true;
#     - a file that is there must have exactly the hash in the manifest. Another hash means
#       the file changed since the manifest was written, so the tests that use it may no
#       longer test what they were written for.
#   An entry's "name" may be a path relative to its folder, with forward slashes.
#   With -Update it writes the current hashes into the manifest instead of comparing them.
#
# WHO CALLS IT
#   - scripts/verify.ps1, before the build; so the git pre-commit hook, Claude's commit
#     hook and CI all run it
#   - you, with -Update, after you changed a fixture on purpose:
#       powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/check-testdata.ps1 -Update
#   - Claude, in the /validate skill, to list which large files are available
#   Never use -Update to make a failing check pass: a hash changes only with a deliberate
#   change to its fixture. First find out why the file changed.
#
# RESULT
#   exit 0  every required file is there with the right hash (yellow warnings allowed)
#   exit 1  a required file is missing (red MISSING) or has another hash (red HASH)
