# install-hooks.ps1 - tells git to run this project's git hooks at every commit.
#
# WHAT IT DOES
#   git can run small scripts, called hooks, at fixed moments. The kit has three:
#   scripts/hooks/pre-commit (the gate, at every commit), scripts/hooks/pre-merge-commit (the
#   same gate, at a merge git records without conflicts) and scripts/hooks/commit-msg (the
#   one-line message rule). git looks for hooks in the folder named by its setting
#   core.hooksPath; this script sets it, depending on where the project sits:
#     - standalone repository (this folder is the git root): core.hooksPath = scripts/hooks,
#       so git runs the files in scripts/hooks/ directly;
#     - folder inside a monorepo (a bigger repository, like photo): it copies the three hooks to
#       <git root>/.githooks/, with Unix (LF) line endings, and sets core.hooksPath for the
#       whole repository to the absolute path of the main checkout's .githooks/ (for photo,
#       E:/Photografie/Code/.githooks). That one copy serves every project folder and every
#       worktree: the pre-commit hook finds each project's own scripts/verify.ps1 by itself.
#       The path is absolute so that every worktree, a hand-made one included, runs the copy
#       the main checkout has checked out, normally main's; a relative one would run each
#       branch's own copy (the kit's ADR 0016).
#   It changes only the git setting and the .githooks/ copy; it runs no check. It warns when a
#   per-worktree setting (config.worktree) hides the one it wrote.
#
# WHO CALLS IT
#   Nobody automatically. You run it by hand:
#       powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/install-hooks.ps1
#   - standalone: once after git init, and once in every new clone (git settings are not
#     cloned);
#   - monorepo: only the kit's copy, once in every new clone, and after a hook in
#     scripts/hooks/ changed, to refresh .githooks/ (then commit .githooks/). A project's own
#     copy would overwrite .githooks/ with that project's hooks, which may be older. A new
#     project folder needs no install. Run from a worktree, it writes the copy in that
#     worktree, but git keeps running the main checkout's copy until the change is merged.
#
# RESULT
#   exit 0  hooks installed; it prints what it set
#   exit 1  not inside a git repository, or git config failed
