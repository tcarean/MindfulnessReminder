# mutate.ps1 - measures how well the tests guard the Core code (mutation testing).
#
# WHAT IT DOES
#   Stryker.NET makes many small deliberate bugs ("mutants") in the Core project, for
#   example turning < into <= or + into -, and runs the tests against each one. A mutant the
#   tests catch is "killed"; one they miss "survives" and points at a missing or weak test.
#   This script fetches Stryker if it is not there yet (a local tool, pinned in
#   .config/dotnet-tools.json), runs it from the test project kit.json names
#   (mutate.testProject, in the kit tests/Starter.Tests/) with the stryker-config.json there,
#   then prints the score and every survivor as file:line with the change that was made.
#   It changes no source file. The full report goes to
#   <test project>/StrykerOutput/<timestamp>/reports/mutation-report.html (and .json).
#
# WHO CALLS IT
#   - you, by hand, after adding or changing numeric code, or before a release:
#       powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/mutate.ps1
#   - Claude, in the /mutate skill, which turns the survivors into proposed tests
#   Not part of scripts/verify.ps1: it runs the whole test suite once per mutant, so it takes
#   minutes, not seconds (the kit's ADR 0008). On a large suite always pass -Mutate.
#
# OPTIONS
#   -Mutate "**/Stats.cs"   only mutate matching files (faster, focused)
#   -BreakAt 80             exit 1 when the mutation score is below 80 %
#   -TestProject <folder>   the test project Stryker runs from (default: kit.json's)
#
# RESULT
#   Stryker's own exit code: 0 when it finished (and the score reached -BreakAt, if given),
#   non-zero when the score is below -BreakAt or Stryker itself failed.
