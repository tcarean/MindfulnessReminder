# claude-commit-gate.ps1 - stops a git commit by Claude unless the gate is green.
#
# WHAT IT DOES
#   Claude Code calls it before every shell command Claude is about to run, and hands it the
#   command as JSON on standard input. Anything that is not a git commit passes at once
#   (exit 0), so ordinary commands cost almost nothing. For a git commit it:
#     1. blocks a commit that would skip the git hooks: --no-verify, -n alone or in a group of
#        short options (-anm), or git -c core.hooksPath=...;
#     2. finds the folder the commit runs in (the kit's ADR 0020), and blocks the commit when
#        the command names a folder it cannot find (a variable, a folder that does not exist);
#     3. blocks the commit unless that folder is on a branch named claude/..., the branches the
#        assistant creates: main, any other branch and a detached HEAD are the owner's, who
#        commits there by hand (the kit's ADR 0021);
#     4. asks git, in that folder, which files the commit takes (the staged ones, plus the
#        changed tracked ones with -a) and finds the project of each: the nearest folder above
#        it holding scripts/verify.ps1, as the git pre-commit hook does. With no such file, the
#        project of the folder itself;
#     5. runs, for each project once, scripts/verify.ps1, the full gate. Whether the commit
#        needs a CHANGELOG line is a judgment, not checked here (the kit's ADR 0023).
#   If it fails, the commit does not run, and Claude gets the reason and the output.
#   It fails closed: an error inside this hook itself also blocks the commit (exit 2), it
#   never lets one through by accident. Next to the git pre-commit hook it is a second check
#   that does not depend on the git hooks being installed, and it catches --no-verify, which
#   skips them. A commit that touches no project passes, as it does in pre-commit.
#
#   The folder of the commit is the session's current folder (`cwd` in the JSON; else
#   CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, else this process's), moved by every cd, chdir, Set-Location, sl,
#   pushd, Push-Location, popd and Pop-Location before the commit in the same command (text
#   inside a heredoc or a PowerShell here-string does not count), then by each
#   `git -C <path>` of the commit. A relative path is taken from the folder before it; a
#   Git Bash path (/e/...) is read as E:\...; a backslash before a space is Bash's escape.
#   CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR alone is not enough: it stays at the folder the session started in,
#   while the commit is usually made in a worktree.
#
# WHO CALLS IT
#   Claude Code, as a PreToolUse hook on its Bash and PowerShell tools, configured in
#   .claude/settings.json (timeout 600 s); only when Claude Code runs in this project folder.
#   Nobody calls it by hand. Windows only, like the settings that call it (powershell, cmd).
#
# RESULT (as Claude Code reads it)
#   exit 0  let the command run
#   exit 2  block the command; the text on stderr is shown to Claude as the reason
#   Any other exit code would mean "let it run, just show the text", so this hook never
#   ends with one on purpose.
