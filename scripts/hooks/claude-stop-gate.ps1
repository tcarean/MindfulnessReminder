# claude-stop-gate.ps1 - keeps Claude from ending its answer with unverified code.
#
# WHAT IT DOES
#   Claude Code calls it each time Claude is about to finish an answer (a "turn"). It takes
#   the list of files this session edited and groups them by project: the nearest folder above
#   each file that holds kit.json (Find-KitProject in kit-config.ps1), so an edit in a worktree
#   is judged by that worktree's copy of the project, not by the folder the session started in
#   (the kit's ADR 0020). A file in no project is not judged. Each project gets two checks,
#   on its own files, with its own kit.json:
#     A. the shared folders (Get-KitSharedFolders in kit-config.ps1: scripts/, .claude/skills/,
#        .claude/agents/, .claude/rules/kit/) are the kit's: in a project that is not the kit
#        (kit.json's "kit" is not "."), an edit under one of them ends no turn; the change is
#        made in the kit and copied with scripts/sync.ps1. The process keys of
#        .claude/settings.json are the kit's too, but a project edits its own allow entries in
#        the same file, so they are checked at commit time, by step 0 of verify.ps1, not here.
#     B. code was edited (kit.json's codeFolders, codeFiles or testFolders): the turn may end
#        only when scripts/verify.ps1 ran green with tests after the last such edit:
#        .verify-stamp, which only such a run writes (-SkipTests does not), is newer than the
#        newest edited file. Whether the change needs a CHANGELOG line is a judgment, not
#        checked here (the kit's ADR 0023).
#   If not, it answers exit 2 with the reasons under each project's full path, and Claude Code sends Claude back to work
#   (the message points to /wrap-up). It never runs verify itself, so it takes under a
#   second. When Claude is already continuing because of this hook (stop_hook_active), it
#   lets the turn end, so a session can never be trapped in a loop.
#
# WHO CALLS IT
#   Claude Code, as the Stop hook in .claude/settings.json, at the end of every turn; only
#   when Claude Code runs in this project folder. Nobody calls it by hand. It reads two
#   files written by others:
#     - %TEMP%\claude-edits-<session id>.txt, the files this session edited, written by
#       scripts/hooks/claude-track-edits.ps1;
#     - .verify-stamp in each project folder, written by that project's scripts/verify.ps1.
#
# RESULT (as Claude Code reads it)
#   exit 0  the turn may end
#   exit 2  the turn goes on; the text on stderr tells Claude what is missing
#
# Errors inside this script are not shown and do not stop it (SilentlyContinue): it carries
# on with the next line.
