# merge-publish.ps1 - merges one published folder into another, refusing to overwrite a file.
#
# WHAT IT DOES
#   Puts every file under -From into -Into, at the same relative path, in two passes:
#     1. compares each file of -From with the file of the same relative path under -Into, if
#        there is one, by SHA-256 (a fingerprint of the file's bytes). Equal bytes: the file
#        is already there, skipped. Different bytes: a collision, two publishes that want
#        different files at one path (two runtime versions, two versions of a library, two
#        licence files);
#     2. copies the files that are not under -Into yet, subfolders kept, but only when pass 1
#        found no collision. On any collision nothing is copied, not even the files that do
#        not collide, so -Into is left as it was.
#   A release that bundles several publishes into one folder (release.publish in kit.json)
#   would otherwise let the last publish overwrite the others' files unseen (the kit's ADR
#   0036).
#
# WHO CALLS IT
#   - scripts/release.ps1, step 5, once per release.publish entry, from its staging folder
#     into artifacts/<version>/<output>/
#   - you, by hand, to see what two publishes have in common:
#       powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/merge-publish.ps1 -From a -Into b
#
# OPTIONS
#   -From <dir>   the folder to take the files from; required, must exist
#   -Into <dir>   the folder to put them in; required, created when absent
#
# RESULT
#   exit 0  merged; it prints how many files were copied and how many were already there
#   exit 1  one line per collision, "collision  <relative path>  (<From> differs from <Into>)",
#           and nothing copied
#   exit 2  any other error (a missing -From, a failed copy), with its message; release.ps1
#           tells it from a collision by this code. After a failed copy the files this run
#           copied are removed again; folders it created may stay, empty
