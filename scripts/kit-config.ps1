# kit-config.ps1 - reads kit.json, the one file that makes the shared scripts fit a project.
#
# WHAT IT DOES
#   Every script in scripts/ is the same in the kit and in every project made from it; what
#   differs per project (the solution name, where the code and the tests are, what a release
#   publishes) lives in kit.json at the project root, never in a script. This file is
#   dot-sourced by the scripts (". (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'kit-config.ps1')") and gives them
#   Read-KitConfig, which reads <project folder>/kit.json and returns its values with the paths
#   already normalised (forward slashes, one trailing slash on folders), and Find-KitProject,
#   which finds the project a file or folder belongs to (the Claude Code hooks use it, the
#   kit's ADR 0020), Get-KitShell, the PowerShell to start another script with, and
#   Get-KitSharedFolders, the one list of the folders that are the kit's in every project
#   (sync.ps1 mirrors them, the Stop hook guards them; the kit's ADR 0028), with
#   Get-KitSharedFolderNames, the same list as both scripts' messages print it.
#   A missing kit.json, or a missing required key, is an error with the key named: a project
#   that has scripts/ must say what it is; nothing is guessed from the folder layout.
#
#   Keys (the kit's own kit.json is the example to copy):
#     solution            the .sln file verify.ps1 restores, formats, builds and tests
#     testFilter          optional; a `dotnet test --filter` expression the gate applies
#                         ("" runs everything)
#     codeFolders         folders whose change needs a green verify before a Claude turn
#                         ends (claude-stop-gate.ps1)
#     codeFiles           optional; single files that count as code, the same way
#     testFolders         folders whose change needs a green verify before a turn ends
#     testData.folder     the folder holding manifest.json, fixtures/ and large/
#     testData.largeEnv   the environment variable that may point at the large files instead
#     mutate.testProject  the test project folder Stryker runs from (its stryker-config.json)
#     release.publish     what release.ps1 publishes: a list of { project, output, args };
#                         output is a subfolder of artifacts/<version>/ ("" is that folder
#                         itself), args are extra `dotnet publish` arguments. project may be
#                         in a sibling project (`../X/...`), which is then a component:
#                         bundled from its clean checkout and listed in release.json (the
#                         kit's ADR 0036)
#     release.zip         optional; the file name of the zip of artifacts/<version>/, written
#                         to artifacts/ with a .sha256 beside it; `{version}` is replaced;
#                         absent or empty: no zip
#     release.branch      optional; the branch a release is cut on ("main" when absent;
#                         release.ps1 refuses any other, the kit's ADR 0029)
#     audit.alsoRead      optional; files or folders, besides docs/ and the test data README
#                         and manifest, that the docs-auditor agent may read: expected outputs,
#                         notices. Never code.
#     kit                 optional; the kit folder, relative to the project ("." in the kit
#                         itself). sync.ps1 copies the shared folders (Get-KitSharedFolders)
#                         and the process keys of .claude/settings.json from there, and
#                         verify.ps1 checks that they are identical. Absent: no check, sync by
#                         hand.
